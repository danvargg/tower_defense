    Given a starting tile `start_tile` and a set of
    `stop_positions` recursively -- using Depth-First Search --

    Shortest Path or A*. Instead it randomly walks in a cardinal
    direction until it finds a valid stop position. At that point it
    exits the search and returns the path.

    This approach is more organic as it allows for enemies to wander
    towards a goal without necessarily picking the optimal path.

    The general principle of how `_walk` works is simple:

    1. When _walk is invoked it's given a path list (it might be empty)
    and the current tile it needs to investigate. if that tile is
    already in `visited` or `None`, return an empty list.

    2. Add the current tile to `visited` and check if the current tile
    is a stop position. If it is, return the current tile + our path.

    3. Given four cardinal directions (N, S, E, W) shuffle them and
    call _walk on them, passing in our existing `path` plus the
    current tile.

    4. If the return value of _walk is not an empty list, we exit ---
    we found a path from start to stop. If it is not, try another
    cardinal direction, and go to 1.
